# agile-theme-tools-omeka
Agile Theme Tools module that extends Omeka S’s standard theming capabilities. These extensions include the ability to designate content to pre-defined content regions, and a series of additional block types that perform a variety of functions.

These additional blocks will most likely require custom supporting css in your theme layer.

Agile Theme Tools is still in development.
